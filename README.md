Text-to-Morse Code Converter
This is a Flask web application that allows users to input text and convert it to Morse code. Additionally, users can upload a file and send a contact message via email through the "Contact Us" page.

Features
Text-to-Morse Conversion: Enter any text, and the application will convert it to Morse code.
File Upload: Upload a file that can be used for further processing (not yet implemented).
Contact Form: Users can submit a contact form, and the message will be sent to the admin via email.
Requirements
Before running the project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies as follows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
MY_GMAIL=your_gmail_account
PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
How to Obtain a Gmail App Password
Go to your Google Account Security Settings.

Go to "App Passwords" and generate a new app password for "Mail" on the device type you prefer.
Use the generated password for the PASSWORD environment variable.

How it Works
Text-to-Morse Converter: Users can input text, and it will be converted to Morse code using the morse_library dictionary.
Contact Form: Users can send a message through the contact form, and the Flask application sends an email to the admin.
File Upload: A form allows users to upload a file, though this feature is not fully implemented yet.
Future Improvements
File Processing: Allow users to upload a text file and have the text converted into Morse code automatically.
Better Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling and input validation.
User Authentication: Add user authentication and profile management.
